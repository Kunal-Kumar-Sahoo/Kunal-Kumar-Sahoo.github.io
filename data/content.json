        "about": "I am a Ph.D. candidate at the School of Artificial Intelligence, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi working on embodied intelligence systems and how they interact with the physical world. My research centres on building compact, interpretable models and control policies that operate reliably on edge and robotic platforms. I have contributed to applied research in reinforcement learning for manipulation and traffic control, energy- and latency-aware model scheduling for heterogeneous devices, and explainable deep learning for speech tasks. My work has produced peer-reviewed contributions and patent applications, and I regularly teach workshops and give invited talks to share practical and methodological advances with students and practitioners.",
